WhatIsUnicode_Title = What is Unicode?
WhatIsUnicode_Descritption = Fundamentally, computers just deal with numbers. They store letters \
  and other characters by assigning a number for each one. Before Unicode was invented, there were \
  hundreds of different encoding systems for assigning these numbers. No single encoding could \
  contain enough characters: for example, the European Union alone requires several different \
  encodings to cover all its languages. Even for a single language like English no single encoding \
  was adequate for all the letters, punctuation, and technical symbols in common use.\n\nThese \
  encoding systems also conflict with one another. That is, two encodings can use the same number \
  for two different characters, or use different numbers for the same character. Any given \
  computer (especially servers) needs to support many different encodings; yet whenever data is \
  passed between different encodings or platforms, that data always runs the risk of corruption.
